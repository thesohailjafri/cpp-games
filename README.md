Game developers have been building games with C++ for decades. C++ allows you to develop games across various platforms, including Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and iOS. You need a game engine to create games, and C++ is used in numerous 2D game engines and 3D game engines. Godot and Unreal Engine, for instance, use C++ as their scripting language. The Unity game engine is written in C#, but its runtime language is C++. By now, many gaming APIs are written in C++. Its popularity is not the reason it’s great for game development, though.

C++ has stark advantages for game development when it comes to ensuring high performance. High performance (i.e. minimum latency) is an essential requirement for game design. During gameplay, several objects need to move in a given second. Even one extra second of lag can break immersion for game players. Because C++ allows you to speak to machine hardware, you can manipulate hardware and control memory management to optimize applications for speed.

Two common concerns that developers have about learning C++ are: 
  1. Manipulating hardware is risky.
  2. C++ code takes too long to write.
  
### Why you should learn C++ for game development
Anyone who’s serious about working in the game industry should learn C++. C++ code allows you to speak directly to hardware and optimize your applications in ways that aren’t possible when using higher-level languages. This ability to take ownership of hardware components will make you a more nimble and competitive game programmer.

If you’re not interested in game development, you should learn C++ anyway. Whether you’re already a software engineer or new to software development, there’s a lot to gain from learning an intermediate language like C++. You’ll understand far more about how computers operate because of its low-level language components.

Two most popular games which we have been included in our repository by solving the previous errors are as follows
  1. Ping Pong
  2. Quiz Game
 
 #### 1. Ping- Pong
 PING PONG is a computer game inspired from table tennis, which was a popular and mind catching game in the early stages of digital game development. Two users can play at the same time and it’s portable.The main features of PING PONG game are - It has a variety of states, state change requires the keyboard input, mainly focused on detecting rectangle collision. It’s a multiplayer game.
  ###### Instructions
  -  Press w or Up Arrow to move up.
  -  Press s or Down Arrow to move down.
  -  Press Spacebar to pause the game.
  -  Press Esc to quit the game.  
  -  Press any key to go to menu.
  - Press r or ENTER to play again.

#### 2. Quiz Game
It mainly focuses on algorithms and basics of data structure concepts.It contains complex iterations and functions. The array and structure concepts are used to implement the project.This quiz generally works on the data stored in the code. It is a single choice correct type questions quiz, and the score obtained is displayed at the end of a game.
 
This quiz game is designed to display certain questions onto the screen and the user guesses the correct answer. If the user enters the correct choice, then it will
add 1 points to the total score and if a user is unable to guess the correct answer then no negative marking will be performed. Then we will match the selected answer with the correct answer. The total score at the end of this game is 10. After completing 10 question we will print the result that how many answers of that user was correct and how many of them was incorrect.

 ###### Instructions
 -  Every question has 4 options, out of which only one is correct.
  -  For every correct answer, 1 points are awarded.
  -  There is no negative marking.
  -  Once answered, it cannot be modified and the next question will be displayed immediately.
  -  A progress bar is displayed at the end, which indicates the number of questions answered.
  - Once all the questions are answered, the final score is displayed on the screen.
